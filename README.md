## Manual Installation

  1. Download the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) library, and place it in a `libraries` folder in your site's docroot.
  2. Download the [Font Awesome Iconpicker](https://itsjavi.com/fontawesome-iconpicker/) library, and place it in a `libraries` folder in your site's docroot.
  3. After downloading and moving the files, you should see files in the following paths:
    - Font Awesome CSS: `docroot/libraries/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css`
    - Iconpicker CSS: `docroot/libraries/fontawesome-iconpicker/dist/css/fontawesome-iconpicker.min.css`

Install the module, and create a new field using the Font Awesome Iconpicker field type.
